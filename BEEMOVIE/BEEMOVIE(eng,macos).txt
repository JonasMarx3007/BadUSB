STRING :

HOME
STRING :
ENTER
HOME
STRING The bee, of course, flies anyway
ENTER
HOME
STRING :

HOME
STRING (Barry and Adam stop walking and it is revealed to the audience that

HOME
STRING It's just a status symbol.
ENTER
HOME
STRING Bees make too much of it.

STRING BARRY:
ENTER

STRING :

ENTER

STRING They're very lovable creatures.
ENTER

ENTER
HOME
STRING :

STRING Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
ENTER
HOME
STRING BARRY:

STRING You mean like this?
ENTER
HOME
STRING (The bear from Over The Hedge barges in through the back door and it is

HOME
STRING So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
ENTER

ENTER
HOME
STRING MR. STING:
ENTER
HOME
STRING - I was with a band called The Police.

STRING No, I haven't.
ENTER
HOME
STRING BARRY:

ENTER
HOME
STRING No, you haven't. And so here
